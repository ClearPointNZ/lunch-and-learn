# Please Note

The frontend code for this POC has been removed but is an extension of the code from [this](https://github.com/ClearPointNZ/developer-assessment/tree/main/Frontend) repo. All you have to do is hook up the UI code that saves an item when adding it. In the backend folder the API has code so save it to the In Memory DB and push the item to service-bus.
